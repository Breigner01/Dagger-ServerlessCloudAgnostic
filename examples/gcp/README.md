# GCP Examples

You can have a look at the [plan.cue](./plan.cue) file which contains the example to deploy a serverless cloud function with GCP.

If you want to deploy this cloud function, you can simply provide your service key and your project name.

The service key needs to be a `secrets` folder and be named `serviceKey.json`

Once you've setup everything, you can simply run:

```shell
dagger do HelloWorld
```
It will deploy a cloud function sending back HelloWorld when you make a request on the url.
